h1. Boiler: An experiment in client-side everything.

h2. What the hell?

Its a "boilerplate" html file that loads a mustache.js template and a data file from URLs specified as GET parameters, mashes them up, and replaces its own contents with the output.

h2. Why!?

For near-real-time updates without complicated push/comet infrastructure.  Clients can poll for a small datafile hosted on very cheap infrastructure (S3, etc.) and render it using a template that was fetched on load. The data file can be updated by a server process with no knowledge of its users and the client can repeat its fetch-and-render cycle very frequently.

The code as written is currently targeted at embeddable widgets, but the principle would be straightforward to apply to full-pages.

h2. Usage

You will need a way to serve the files.  I suggest executing the following Python one-liner:

<pre>
% python -m SimpleHTTPServer
</pre>

Then visit:

<pre>
http://localhost:8000/boiler.html?template=examples/template.html&data=examples/data.json
(basic json)

http://localhost:8000/boiler.html?template=examples/template.html&data=examples/data.csv
(in-browser parsed CSV)
</pre>

h2. Is it tested?

Not at all.  Only in the latest non-dev Chrome and only on OSX.

h2. Notes/TODO

* No clue if URLs as params are browser compatible.
* A very rough implementation of in-browser CSV parsing is included--the idea being that Google Docs could be used as a backend. (Not sure if Google throttles frequent requests for published docs.)
* Hashing may be used to avoid re-rendering identical content.
* Its entirely unclear how fast this is or how frequent polling could be on "average" computers.
* In the future boiler will take a param specifying how often to poll for new content and automatically show/hide a loading icon ("throbber") in the rendered template (likely using a magic div id).
